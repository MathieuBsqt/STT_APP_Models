## Python Script to download some AI Models required by the Speech to Text App

This script allows you to download the models recquired by our [Speech to Text Application](https://github.com/ovh/ai-training-examples/tree/main/apps/streamlit/speech-to-text) and put them in an `Object Storage`.

Storing your models in a folder will save you a lot of time. Indeed, you won't have to download them every time you launch the app üòÅ!
